# Contributing
Your input is appreciated! Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. You are welcome to simply fork the repo and create your branch from `master`, make your changes and create a pull request that will then be reviewed by a maintainer.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/AdorianM/Assembly-From-Image/issues)
GitHub issues are used to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/AdorianM/Assembly-From-Image/issues/new). It's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
