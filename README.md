# Assembly From Image

Transforms a PNG image into an assembly variable

Just drag & drop your PNG file to Serve.exe (or manually run the .py script with the png location as an argument) and you'll get a file containing the declaration of an assembly compatible variable.

Customization can be added if you run the application. A small interface with features like: selecting input/output location, selecting a variable name.

An input directory can be selected to convert all the images inside it. The directory input has priority over the file input in the case both are selected. Additionally, the directory should only contain image files.
